                <p class="Text ">"A great working environment is a heady mixture that induces people to work with all their passion. It keeps them performing even in your absence, inspires to achieve bigger without the need to push, contributes to your brand taking little
                    in return. Developing a good work environment involves working on streamlining the organizational structure, internal communication, core process, and work space as well as recognizing the talent."</p>

                <h1 class="Heading ">Hierarchy Redefined</h1>
                <p class="Text ">"Hierarchies define how company processes work and how people connect with each other. At InfoJiva, if you are good at something, you become the consultant of that task, leading and guiding the team. In other words, it is a slight twist
                    to the perfect model practiced in general. A performer is always recognized.
                    <br><br> “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.” – Steve Jobs
                    <br><br>Leadership is not about making people work, but about leading people by example. We do have one to keep things in order – leadership, engineering, and implementation teams. Irrespective of what you do, the ability to take on
                    challenges and innovate takes you ahead at InfoJiva."

                <p class="Text ">"Hierarchical levels need not create communication bottlenecks, draining the energy and enthusiasm out of people at work. Learning from the experts, getting tips on eliminating bugs, or sharing your own ideas on solving problems should
                    keep you tuned for the future. We take care to bridge the gap and break away communication barriers with an open mindset, and let the ideas flow freely."</p>

                    in better management-employee interaction, conflict-free, positive work environment, gender equality, room for personalization, and flexible work timings are some of the cues to create great workspaces."</p>

                    a niche in related fields, and recognizing their achievements is essential. We believe a great work environment, along with the best compensation in the market for a performer, should attract the right talent."</p>
